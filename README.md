# Object-Tracking-and-Parabolic-Motion-Analysis
Note: This project was a requirement for the course ENPM 673- Perception for Autonomous Robots at University of Maryland, College Park

## Project Description
The project involves tracking a moving object in a video by detecting its centroid across frames and fitting a parabolic trajectory using the Standard Least Squares method.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.11.11
* Google Colab

## Libraries used
* OpenCv
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Instructions
* Clone the repository or download the zip file. Upload the 'kinikara_project1_part1.ipynb' file to Google Drive along with the 'object_tracking.mp4' file. Click on the '.ipynb' file, which would open it in Google Colab. In code snippet 2, change 'path_to_folder' to your path.
* Run the code snippets one after the other. The explanation of the concept and the code is in the python notebook
